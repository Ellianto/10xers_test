# 10xers Demo Project  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and created as an assessment entry for the 10xers assessment test. It uses the Bootstrap UI Framework Components sourced from ```react-bootstrap``` library.  

The built project is hosted with Firebase Hosting [here](https://xers-demo.web.app/).  

## Building the app
